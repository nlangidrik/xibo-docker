# Xibo Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com/) is an application to package and run any
application in a pre-configured container making it much easier to deploy a Xibo
CMS with recommended configuration.

This repository holds the docker container definitions for Xibo and the docker-compose
configuration, which is used to bootstrap, start, stop and destroy the installation.

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (to clone this repository)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd xibo-docker
   ```

2. **Configure the environment:**
   ```bash
   cp config.env.template config.env
   # Edit config.env with your settings (especially MYSQL_PASSWORD)
   ```

3. **Start Xibo (Choose your platform):**

   **For Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start-xibo.sh
   ./start-xibo.sh
   ```

   **For Windows:**
   ```cmd
   start-xibo.bat
   ```

4. **Access Xibo:**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost`
   - Complete the Xibo setup wizard

### Optional: Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup

For production deployments with SSL and better security:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x setup-nginx.sh

# Run the Nginx setup script
sudo ./setup-nginx.sh
```

This will:
- Install Nginx and Certbot
- Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt
- Set up proper security headers
- Configure WebSocket support for XMR
- Set up automatic SSL renewal

### Stopping Xibo

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./stop-xibo.sh
```

**For Windows:**
```cmd
stop-xibo.bat
```

## Manual Installation
Full installation instructions for supported use of these containers can be
found in the [Xibo
Manual](http://xibo.org.uk/manual-tempel/en/install_cms.html)

## Directory structure

This repository contains Docker configuration (Dockerfile) for the Xibo
containers. A normal installation *only* requires `docker-compose.yaml` and
a `config.env.template` file, suitably configured, saved as `config.env`.

#### /containers

web and xmr Dockerfiles and associated configuration. These are built by Docker
Hub and packaged into `xibosignage/xibo-cms` and `xibosignage/xibo-xmr`.

#### DATA_DIR/shared

Data folders for the Xibo installation.

 - The Library storage can be found in `/shared/cms/library`
 - The database storage can be found in `/shared/db`
 - Automated daily database backups can be found in `/shared/backup`
 - Custom themes should be placed in `/shared/cms/web/theme/custom`
 - Custom modules should be placed in `/shared/cms/custom`
 - Any user generated PHP or resources external to Xibo that you want hosted
   on the same webserver go in `/shared/cms/web/userscripts`. They will then
   be available to you at `http://localhost/userscripts/`

## Running without docker-compose
If you have your own docker environment you may want to run without the
automation provided by docker-compose. If this is the case you will be responsible
for pulling the docker containers, starting them and manually installing Xibo.
